# 2. An issue status

Date: 2023-02-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The GitHub project provides a status mechanism, with which we can set the status of an issue.
This document describe how we use these statuses to manage issues in our projects.

## Decision

We have decided to use statuses as described below:

- No status - the issue is in draft,
- Todo - the issue is ready to assign to developer,
- In progress - the issue is being developed,
- Done - task completed.

## Consequences

By using these statuses, we can manage our tasks on our board more easily.
